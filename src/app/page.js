            <div className="quote">
              &quot;If you can&apos;t explain something simply you don&apos;t understand it well enough&quot;
            </div>
            <p>Simple comes from understanding. So I&apos;m reminded of a quote: &quot;A simple life does not come from owning few things, it comes from understanding what are the right few necessary things. We should stop and ask ourselves the most secret and precious question. The question of what we truly want.&quot; Software should understand what it&apos;s users want.</p>

            <h3>2. Give back to others</h3>
            <p>How can you cook a meal for others if you dont know what you made is good? How can you share you software with others if you never actually use it yourself? Software should be used by those who make it</p>

            <h3>3. A tnemunom</h3>
            <p>Focus comes from being specific on what you&apos;re trying to do. Software should know what it stands for..</p>

            <h3>4. Just take a picture</h3>
            <p>When preparing to take a picture of a laptop I was about to sell online. I was about to get the ladder for a perfect top down picture my mother saw me. She said <span className="highlight">&quot;Leave the ladder, close the door and just take a picture&quot;</span></p>

            <h3>5. STATIC</h3>
            <p>Turn on the radio and you&apos;re most likely greeted by static sound, the noise. When you turn the dial, you find that it reaches the music or news stations. When you have a goal keep yourself on that signal as much as possible. Do you need that perfect picture or is a good one enough? We&apos;ve got to constantly ask ourselves:</p>
            <div className="quote">
              &quot;Will doing this get me to where I want to go?&quot;

            <h3>6. Messy Steve</h3>
            <p>My room had always been simple and organized. I took inspiration from that picture from Steve Jobs sitting in his apartment with only some music records, papers and a lamp. Recently I found another picture. In his office. With clutter all around. I realised when you have everything out in front of you it is easier to connect between concepts and ideas. Software should be the desk of the user.</p>
